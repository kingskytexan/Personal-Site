				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Hi, I'm Thomas Butler Klapheke also known as Tommy! I'm a Bellarmine University graduate with a Bachelor's of Arts in Computer Science along with a minor in Mathematics. Technology has been something that I have always loved since day one when I got into the Nintendo 64 and the Gameboy when I was young. I got hardcore into programming when I was in college, when I was talking a Basic Website Design class. After taking that class, I've been into software engineering and development ever since. After Code Louisville's Front End Development Track, I plan on doing Swift Development on my own, while going through the Python and Django Development Track that will be offered this upcoming September.</p>
				<p>I have a Facebook and Linkedin account. Feel free to look me up!</p>
				<p>My coding portfolio is located on Github and here my it is: <a href="http://www.github.com/kingskytexan">King's Crown</a> </p>
